We must apologize for our absence as we had to take some time off to recharge ourselves. We trust everyone is doing great and happy to be back. We hope everyone will join this virtual meetup (and the FOSSASIA SUMMIT) as it's been a while since we get together as a community.</p> <p>To kick things off, we are holding a joint meetup this month with the FOSSASIA team to warm things up for FOSSASIA SUMMIT happening online from Apr 7-9 2022. We are pleased to have Mario and Hong Phuc, as well as members from FOSSASIA team to join us on this warm up event to FOSSASIA. We know how much we miss a physical event where we could meet fellow FOSS enthusiasts but we are optimistic that it could happen next year.</p> <p>Join the FOSSASIA Virtual Summit 2022 to learn about the latest development in open source technologies and to connect with developers, tech communities, and companies from around the world.</p> <p>The event will take place from Thursday, 7th April to Saturday, 9th April.

The use of hydrogen as a fuel is not new but its recent emergence as a viable large-scale energy source has many observers excited.<br/>Hydrogen can be transported as a liquid or gas, similar to oil and natural gas. When used in fuel cells, hydrogen delivers enough energy per kilogram to rival jet fuel.

It also makes stakeholders happy because the project looks as if it’s moving forward. Product Discovery is often less tangible and glamorous, and you could be spending weeks doing user research to come up with seemingly “obvious” insights. However, this is the critical work that needs to happen to validate assumptions, uncover user motivations, and paint a well-rounded picture of the problem space you’re in.The risk of rushing through this problem identification and prioritization step is that there is a higher chance you’re not actually building the right product in the right sequence to solve your customer’s core needs. You may reduce one or two pain points, but the cause of the problem still exists and is unaddressed. It could feel like the product is never finished because the users are still asking for features to fulfill needs that you thought you already solved.How do we avoid this cycle?

The report indicates the top factor driving companies to increase budgets is an elevated priority on IT projects.</p> <p>IT can make or break a startup. Whether it’s having dependable cloud infrastructure or a reliable IT support team to field customer issues, how well a startup executes their IT operation is a key indicator of success. While tech startups might seem uniquely positioned to handle IT implementation and management, IT functions can be a burden on funding and resources.</p> <p>That’s why many companies are turning to managed services. According to the report, in 2022, companies plan to spend significantly more of their tech budgets on managed services, which involve outsourcing IT functions to a third-party. Small-and-medium-sized businesses plan to spend 14 percent of their IT budgets on managed services.</p> <p>IT outsourcing is an increasingly popular business strategy.
