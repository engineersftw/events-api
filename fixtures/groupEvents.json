For example, the recent success of neural networks based deep learning has been predicated upon availability of large-scale high quality data. While AI algorithms help unlock value from data, there are many attendant risks involved. They range from private sensitive data being leaked (directly or through inference) to adversarial attacks on ML. This is of significant concern due to regulatory compliance issues due to acts such as PDPA and GDPR. Other risks involve bias in the data as well as algorithms and fairness of outcomes. The speakers will first introduce the risks involved related to AI and Data Privacy. They will also touch upon the current thinking as well as the research being done to help manage these risks.</p> <p>PLEASE REGISTER HERE: <a href=\"https://www.sginnovate.com/events/ai-and-data-privacy-risk-management\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sginnovate.com/events/ai-and-data-privacy-risk-management</a></p> <p>Date: 28 August 2019, Wednesday<br/>Time: 3:30pm – 6:00pm<br/>Venue: 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore 059911</p> <p>PLEASE REGISTER HERE: <a href=\"https://www.sginnovate.com/events/ai-and-data-privacy-risk-management\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sginnovate.com/events/ai-and-data-privacy-risk-management</a></p> <p>Speakers:</p> <p>Professor Mohan Kankanhalli, Director, N-CRiPT and Dean, School of Computing,National University of Singapore<br/>Professor Jussi Keppo, Principal Investigator, N-CRiPT and Dean’s Chair, NUS Business School, Co-Director, NUS Business Analytics Center, National University of Singapore</p> <p>PLEASE REGISTER HERE: <a href=\"https://www.sginnovate.com/events/ai-and-data-privacy-risk-management\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sginnovate.com/events/ai-and-data-privacy-risk-management</a></p> <p>Programme Details:<br/>3:30pm – 4:00pm: Registration<br/>4:00pm – 4:05pm: Introduction to NUS Smart Systems Institute<br/>4:05pm – 4:45pm: Keynote Presentations by speakers &amp; Q&amp;A (10 mins for each speaker)<br/>4:45pm – 5:30pm: Panel Discussion &amp; Q&amp;A<br/>5:30 pm – 6:00pm: Networking</p> <p>PLEASE REGISTER HERE: <a href=\"https://www.sginnovate.com/events/ai-and-data-privacy-risk-management\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sginnovate.com/events/ai-and-data-privacy-risk-management</a></p> ",

More venture funding is made available; more startups are securing funding and are growing post series A and Series B funding.</p> <p>There is a lot of work to be done at the bottom of the value chain in terms of cultivating a startup ecosystem. However, this only matters when there are positive liquidity events for all the stakeholders further down the path. This work is essential so that money can be recycled back into the ecosystem to help grow the next generation of startups.</p> <p>In this panel session, we will dive deep into what type of liquidity events are happening in the region today and how this is evolving. We also try to understand what needs or can to be done by founders, investors and stakeholders to contribute to better liquidity outcomes for Singapore and the wider region.</p> <p>Date: 29 August 2019, Thursday<br/>Time: 6:00pm – 8:00pm<br/>Venue: 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore 059911</p> <p>Please sign up at: <a href=\"https://www.sginnovate.com/events/venturing-and-path-liquidity-south-east-asia\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sginnovate.com/events/venturing-and-path-liquidity-south-east-asia</a></p> <p>Programme Details:<br/>6:00pm – 6:30pm: Registration<br/>6:30pm – 7:30pm: Panel Discussion and Q&amp;A<br/>7:30pm – 8:00pm: Networking</p> <p>Please sign up at: <a href=\"https://www.sginnovate.com/events/venturing-and-path-liquidity-south-east-asia\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sginnovate.com/events/venturing-and-path-liquidity-south-east-asia</a></p> ",
