        "description": "According to a recent report, 53 percent of businesses expect their IT budgets to grow over the next 12 months. The report indicates the top factor driving companies to increase budgets is an elevated priority on IT projects.\n\nIT can make or break a startup. Whether it’s having dependable cloud infrastructure or a reliable IT support team to field customer issues, how well a startup executes their IT operation is a key indicator of success. While tech startups might seem uniquely positioned to handle IT implementation and management, IT functions can be a burden on funding and resources.\n\nThat’s why many companies are turning to managed services. According to the report, in 2022, companies plan to spend significantly more of their tech budgets on managed services, which involve outsourcing IT functions to a third-party. Small-and-medium-sized businesses plan to spend 14 percent of their IT budgets on managed services.\n\nIT outsourcing is an increasingly popular business strategy. According to tech entrepreneur [Sudheesh Subhash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudheeshsubhash/#experience) it can help startups cut costs and shift focus to core business activities.\n\nSubhash is the CEO of [NetServ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/netserv-llc/), an IT solutions provider.

        "description": "**Dropbox’s secure document sharing and analytics company DocSend regularly tracks startup investment trends via analysis of pitch decks sent through the platform. According to their analysis from 2021, venture capitalist engagement with startup pitch decks reached an all-time high in Q4 and increased 44 percent across the full year.**\n\nThis analysis underlines the vital role pitch decks play in fundraising. While in-person meetings remain popular, pitch decks today serve as both a calling card for startup founders and an efficient way for VCs to quickly sift through potential opportunities.\n\nThat’s why serial entrepreneur [Jonah Midanik](https://members.foundersnetwork.com/investor/169/) is passionate about giving entrepreneurs the tools necessary to create an effective pitch deck. As a partner and COO at [Forum Ventures](https://www.forumvc.com/), he plays an active role in supporting Founders on their journey. Forum helps B2B SaaS companies go from startup to scale, with investment, an accelerator program focused on go-to-market strategy, and fundraising.\n\n“Being able to support startup founders gives me a lot of satisfaction because I’ve been there,” Midanik says. “It’s a really lonely journey. You’re over-resourced. You’re underpaid. You’re overworked. It can be an incredibly isolating experience.”\n\nOn April 7, 2022, Midanik will be hosting a webinar for Founders Network members where he’ll provide a tutorial on how to craft a pitch deck that makes an impact on investors.\n\nAt his webinar, Midanik will also cover:\n\n* The value of an effective pitch deck\n* What VCs are looking for in your pitch deck\n* How to craft an engaging narrative\n* How to condense your message\n\n**About the Speaker:**\n[Jonah Midanik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonahmidanik/) has spent the last two decades in the Canadian startup ecosystem. He has successfully founded and run both bootstrapped and venture backed companies. Now he spends his time as a partner at [Forum Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/company/forumvc/) supporting B2B SaaS founders with capital, as well as the sales, marketing, fundraising and product help that early stage founders need.\nAn engineer by trade, Serial Entreprenuer by choice, Jonah Midanik supports founders on their journey to building world class companies out of Canada - while occasionally still founding companies of his own.\n\n\\*\\*\\* You must register on Eventbrite to attend this event.

        "description": "**Since its founding in 2020, AI notetaker application Fathom has gained rapid traction. The startup announced it had raised a $4.7 million seed round earlier this year. Additionally, the application, which was developed exclusively for the Zoom Marketplace, secured 10,000 signups early on and is currently the #1 app on the platform.**\n\n[Fathom](https://fathom.video/) Founder and CEO [Richard White](https://members.foundersnetwork.com/profile/329/) attributes Fathom’s early success to the startup’s go-to-market model. The company landed on a bottom up model early on and the model informed much of their strategy.\n“We thought about go to market and distribution at about the same time we came up with the product itself,” White says. “Knowing your go to market model really drives a lot of product decisions, as well as marketing decisions and team composition decisions.”\n\nOn April 12, White will host a webinar for Founders Network members where he’ll discuss different go-to-market models in tech and how deciding on a go-to-market model early on can greatly benefit startups.\n\nAt his webinar, White will also cover\n\n* The benefits and challenges of different GTM models\n* The factors to consider when choosing a go-to-market model\n* What research to conduct before deciding on a go-to-market strategy\n* How GTM strategy is different from a product launch\n\n**About the Speaker:**\n\n**[Richard White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rrwhite/)** is founder and CEO of [Fathom.video](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fathom-video/), a free app that records, transcribes & highlights your calls so you can focus on the conversation instead of taking notes.\n\nFathom was a part of the Y-Combinator W21 batch, is one of only 50 Zoom App Launch Partners, and is one of a small handful of companies Zoom has invested in directly via their Zoom Apps Fund.\n\nPrior to Fathom, Richard founded UserVoice, one of the leading platforms that technology companies, from startups to the Fortune 500, use for managing customer feedback and making strategic product decisions. UserVoice was notable for being the company that originally invented the Feedback tabs shown on the side of millions of websites around the world today.\n\nRichard previously worked on Kiko, a company in the first batch of Y-Combinator, with Justin Kan and Emmett Shear who subsequently went on to found Twitch. Richard is passionate about designing intuitive productivity tools with delightful user experiences.\n\n\\*\\*\\* You must register on Eventbrite to attend this event.

        "description": "Please join the IBM Data Science Community for our March 2022 virtual meetup.\n\n**⏰ Agenda**\n\n* 10.45am – Doors open\n* 11.00am – Welcome\n* 11.02am – IBM Community announcements\n* 11.08am – Lightning talk: Exploring the Manning liveProject tutorial for IBM Project Debater API (Paco Nathan)\n* 11:15am – Main talk: Trustworthy Machine Learning (Kush R. Varshney) plus Q&A\n* 11:55am – Mingle\n* 12:00pm – Official event ends (IBM community team and speakers may stick around a little bit longer if there are still more questions)\n\n**💬 Lighting talk (5') – Exploring the Manning liveProject tutorial for IBM Project Debater API**\n\nSuppose you're on a data science team that handles lots of text: customer responses, news analysis, medical transcriptions, bill of materials, patent applications, or other similar cases. How do you manage data quality within the stream of input data? How do you determine which elements of the surrounding text support the arguments that get extracted by ML models? How do you expand the phrases your customers use to link into more commonly-used phrases?\n\nWhile there have been incredible advances in the use of language models for predicting sequences of text, other areas of NLP have also been advancing. This “liveProject” tutorial at Manning provides goal-oriented, hands-on coding examples of how to leverage the IBM Project Debater API to analyze a Kaggle dataset about medical transcriptions. Milestones in this tutorial include data preparation techniques in Pandas, use of the *Key Point Analysis*, *Argument Quality*, and *Term Wikifier* API services, data visualization in Seaborn, and building an interactive dashboard of the results in Streamlit.\n\n**👨🏻‍💻 Speaker bio**\n\n[Paco Nathan](https://derwen.ai/paco/bio.html) is Managing Partner at Derwen, Inc. Known as a “player/coach”, with core expertise in data science, cloud computing, natural language, graph technologies; \\~40 years tech industry experience, ranging from Bell Labs to early-stage start-ups. Advisor for Amplify Partners, Recognai, KUNGFU.AI. Lead committer PyTextRank, kglab. Formerly: Director, Community Evangelism @ Databricks and Apache Spark.\n\n**💬 Main talk (40') – Trustworthy Machine Learning**\n\nAccuracy is not enough when you’re developing machine learning systems for consequential application domains. You also need to make sure that your models are fair, have not been tampered with, will not fall apart in different conditions, and can be understood by people. Your design and development process has to be transparent and inclusive. You don’t want the systems you create to be harmful, but to help people flourish in ways they consent to. All of these considerations beyond accuracy that make machine learning safe, responsible, and worthy of our trust have been described by many experts as the biggest challenge of the next five years. This talk aims to equip you with the thought process to meet this challenge.\n\n**👨🏻‍💻 Speaker bio**\n\nKush R. Varshney is a distinguished research staff member and manager with IBM Research at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, where he leads the machine learning group in the Foundations of Trustworthy AI department. He was a visiting scientist at IBM Research - Africa, Nairobi, Kenya in 2019. He is the founding co-director of the IBM Science for Social Good initiative. He applies data science and predictive analytics to human capital management, healthcare, olfaction, computational creativity, public affairs, international development, and algorithmic fairness and conducts academic research on the theory and methods of trustworthy machine learning. He self-published a book entitled 'Trustworthy Machine Learning' ([http://www.trustworthymachinelearning.com](http://www.trustworthymachinelearning.com/)) in 2022.\n\n**🦄 Join your local IBM Community meetup team**\n\nWant to get involved in your local IBM Community meetup?

        "description": "**Prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations with Datree open-source CLI**\n\n* While developing Datree, we reviewed 100+ postmortems to discover the recurring patterns, anti-patterns, and root causes of typical outages in Kubernetes-based systems.\n* With the insights that we’ve gathered, we launched our open source Datree.\n* However. the more we deepened our research we learned that governing policies is only the beginning of achieving reliability, security, and stability for your Kubernetes cluster.\n* Surprisingly, we found out that the ultimate solution might be also a key solution for resolving the DevOps vs Development deadlock once and for all.\n* In this session, we'll review some of the top Kubernetes failure stories that we've read and demonstrate how YOU can use the Datree open source project to make sure these mistakes will not happen to you.\n\n**Shimon Tolts**, AWS Community Hero, CEO & Co-Founder at Datree:\n\n* Shimon established and managed the Software Engineering Infrastructure department for 400 engineers at ironSource.\n* Also as an AWS Community Hero, Shimon runs the largest AWS user group worldwide and is an avid speaker at conferences.\n* Today, Shimon is the CEO & Co-Founder at Datree, an automated policy enforcement solution for Kubernetes.\n* It helps to prevent misconfigurations from code through production. Datree allows seamless management and enforcement policies across Developers and DevOps engineers.\n\n**Noaa Barki**, Developer Advocate at Datree:\n\n* Noaa is a senior full-stack developer, community manager, and developer advocate who wishes to encourage developers to deepen the decisions we make during the development processes, research the technologies we use, and share our knowledge.\n* She started her journey in the 8200 Unit of the IDF Intelligence forces where Noaa took her first steps in software development.\n* In the last 5 years, her work has mainly included full-stack development technologies such as Golang, Node.js, React as well as DevOps technologies and infrastructure such as Kubernetes and Helm\n\n**Zoom Details**:\n\n* https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82759599827?pwd=eTN5ZjZuSUNUekNrTXA4Ni9Jbk0xZz09\n* Passcode: 648081",

We will give away a few AWS credits ($20/each) during the event.\n\nDescription:\nCheating in online gaming is on the rise and cheaters are getting increasingly sophisticated at evading human and rule-based detection with their cheats. Machine Learning is seen as the solution which can identify suspicious patterns and adapt to changes in cheater behavior, however a solution like this is often complex to implement and manage, with dedicated data science teams required to operate it effectively.\n\nIn this session, learn how services like Amazon Fraud Detector and Amazon SageMaker can be easily implemented to detect cheaters in online mobile games without any prior AI or ML knowledge required!\n\n* Intended audience: IT engineers/sysadmins/developers interested in learning about AI/ML .\n* Level: Intermediate\n\nMore events up coming (free join from anywhere):\n🔷 Mar 10, Federated Learning Application Runtime Environment.\n🔷 Mar 15, Scaling DL Based Recommenders.\n🔷 Mar 23, Create and Foster a Data-driven Culture.\n🔷 Mar 24, StateOfTheArt() - Applied AI Conference.\n🔷 May 18, apply(conf)- The ML Data Engineering Summit.",

Websites, emails, ads, and even app interfaces are frequently tested. Besides, there are tons of different variables that can be manipulated to generate variants for the test. But before you decide what to do an A/B test on, here are some things to take into account.\n\nMain takeaways:\n\n* There is no one right way of validating a product, A/B testing is just one of them\n* Get your product 'qualitatively' validated before 'quantitatively' validating\n* Use holdouts to measure the long term success of your new products, while running A/B test in parallel\n\nMeet the Speaker: Namrata Panwar\n\nNamrata always goes the extra mile to deliver great user experiences.

While I have not figured it all out, I think I've figured out enough to get anyone new started. As for the fancy file upload UX, I'll leave that for next time when I have it figured out. 😅\n\n➡️ Find all details in the GitHub issue below.\n[https://github.com/rubysg/meetups/issues/36](https://github.com/rubysg/meetups/issues/36)\n➡️ Join the RubySG telegram group for more updates!\n[https://t.me/+TWJ3HtLeJF81EweA](https://t.me/+TWJ3HtLeJF81EweA)\n➡️ Follow us on our website.\n[https://ruby.sg](https://ruby.sg)",

        "description": "iOS Dev Scout 2022 March edition!\n\nJoin us on the 23rd March for an evening of #iOS and #Swift talks, show & tell, and Kahoot!\nWe have 2 awesome speakers who prepared awesome talks for you to learn something new!\n\n[Meetup link]\niOS Dev Scout Meetup Rooftop link will be revealed when you RSVP\nSponsored by Gather.town\n\n[Speaker]\nPriyal Porwal, Senior Software Engineer at PayTM, India\nRudrank Riyam, DevRel Engineer @codemagicio\nTwitter: @rudrankriyam\n\n[First Talk]\nTopic:\n**Enhance user experience with Accessibility and Localization Support in Swift UI by Priyal Porwal**\n\nDescription:\nWe can make our application more accessible and reach a global audience by adding support of Accessibility and Localization in our SwiftUI Application with very little work from the developer’s end\n\nIn this talk, I’ll cover adding custom accessibility and localization support to your Application, using Xcode 13 latest enhancements for getting a quick idea about your app behaviour during development.\n\n[Second Talk]\nTopic:\n**Speeding up Local iOS Builds with Remote Caching by Rudrank Riyam**\n\nDescription:\nDo you wish your local builds were significantly faster?\n\nIn this talk, I go through the concept of remote caching using the open-source tool XCRemoteCache by Spotify. It is a remote cache tool for your Xcode projects that reuses target artifacts. They are generated on a remote machine, preferably on your CI service, uploading to a WebDAV capable REST server. Then, your local machine can access it. This concept can also be applied to different tools.\nNormally, developers compile the project on their machine every time they build it. A remote cache helps you speed up builds by compiling once, and then everyone can use that cache. It is particularly useful for big projects with multiple targets or dependencies that don’t often require updates.\n\nSaving developers’ productive time is crucial, and using XCRemoteCache or a remote caching tool helps them reduce build times by caching targets and dependencies remotely.\n\n[Agenda]\n• 7:00-7:10pm: Welcome! Say hi to other devs, you're free to explore the Rooftop!\n• 7:15pm: Enhance user experience with Accessibility and Localization Support in Swift UI by Priyal Porwal\n• 7:45pm: Speeding up Local iOS Builds with Remote Caching by Rudrank Riyam\n• 8:05pm: Show & Tell\n\nWe're looking for speakers for April 2022 meetup! Ping @iosdevscout or @vinamelody if you're interested :)\n\n[iOS Conf SG 2023]\nCFP for iOS Conf SG 2023 is now open!\nSubmit your proposal now or wait until WWDC https://www.papercall.io/iosconfsg2023\n\n[iOS Dev Scout x iOS Conf SG]\nIn its 12th year running, iOS Dev Scout, which also organises the annual iOS Conf SG, is the largest iOS Community in Singapore, with more than 6K members across our Facebook and Meetup groups.\n\niOS Conf SG has been awarded the ‘Most Commended’ iOS event worldwide by the Swift Community Awards, which celebrates the amazing iOS community worldwide and recognises the hard work of developers, individuals and projects that help make Swift great.\n\nFollow us on Twitter at @iOSDevScout and @iOSConfSG for all the latest updates!\n\nView the video recordings of all our 7 editions of iOS Conf SG from our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/iOSConfSG",

        "description": "The ability to be Agile is also the ability to get into an: action, feedback, outcome, action loop. It is an opportunity for a team to organise themselves to work to their strengths and to manage conflict at source in an anti-fragile way.\n\nA foundation to this way of working is to know yourself and to have a short-hand way of understanding others. We use metaphors - they are interesting, they are sticky and much easier to remember than many other profiling tools AND most importantly, they are self-generated so they can be updated as we grow and change and understand ourselves better.\n\nCaitlin Walker, author of Contempt to Curiosity; creating the conditions for groups to collaborate, has spent over 20 years finding simple sustainable practises that help individuals move from drama to outcome and action.\n\nIn this workshop, Caitlin will introduce you to three of your own metaphors: When you're at your best, when you're at your worst and how you make decisions. From these three metaphors you can start to make predictions for what you need to be at your best and how others might clash with you.\n\nFor an introduction to Clean Questions and Metaphor Models, watch Caitlin's TedX talk here: [https://youtu.be/aVvcU5gG4KU](https://youtu.be/aVvcU5gG4KU)\n\nIf you are interested in uncovering some models used in the Hidden Skills of Agile - Clean Language, please approach the host (Victor Loke) for a free resource. This can be used as a visual aid for using Clean Language to elicit metaphors as resources.\n\n**Caitlin Walker**\nCaitlin has been designing, experimenting, testing, updating and redesigning interventions that support groups to become self-organising. She began with teenagers outside of the school system, moved into IT companies and now delivers projects and trains her approach around the world. She is author of 'From Contempt to Curiosity - creating the conditions for groups to collaborate' and 'So you want to be DramaFree' and has recently completed her PhD in Clean Language Interviewing as a research methodology. Born in Jos, Nigeria, she currently lives near Liverpool and can be found doing executive, team and organisational coaching in person and online.",

        "description": "We're starting off 2022 with a brand new series of After Hours Chatters: a short and sweet session happening every two months where we get together and chat about anything tech related! 🗣\n\nExpect topics such as new technologies, productivity tips, an exciting project in the works, or even if you'd like to just share a handy keyboard shortcut you found! Everyone is encouraged to join the discussion, but don't worry if you're feeling shy, we'll have one or two topics lined up to get you chatting too. Grab your favourite after hours beverage of choice and we'll see you on Zoom!\n\n**Agenda**\nWWCode X Open Government Products: Women in tech in the public sector\n\nOpen Government Products is an experimental development team that builds technology for the public good. Our role is to accelerate the digital transformation of the Singapore Government by being a space where we can experiment with new technologies, management techniques, corporate systems, and even cultural norms.\n\nCheck out the code for the poster here! https://codepen.io/avery/full/mdMNOgj",

However, access to quality data is a common challenge and requires custom code is to consume from different data structures and sources. Learn how Confluent’s pre-built connectors and stream processing solve these issues, by helping organizations take action in real-time with a highly scalable streaming integration platform, and by connecting your common SIEM platforms such as Splunk, Elasticsearch, and many more.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at how stream-processing can be used to perform real-time anomaly detection in streaming event data, filter, and aggregate nosing data, and how to route data from Splunk to Elasticsearch while keeping all its valuable metadata.\n\nAgenda\n\n---\n\nSpeaker\n\nJohnny Mirza - Confluent (Senior Solutions Engineer)\n\nJohnny has a strong technical background supporting the Telco, Media, Insurance, and Transport industry verticals. Johnny comes from a pre-sales solutions engineering background and has a passion for architectures of public cloud and on-premise infrastructure, service assurance and monitoring platforms, and working with open source technologies.\n\nHost\n\nKawnish Panse - Elastic (Community Programs Specialist)\n\n---\n\nTHIS IS A FREE EVENT - PLEASE FINISH YOUR RSVP IN THE LINK BELOW\n\nhttps://community.elastic.co/events/details/elastic-singapore-presents-how-to-modernise-your-siem-with-confluent-and-elasticsearch/",

        "description": "You can provision a cloud native GraphQL API layer and start serving applications within minutes. However, readying this layer for production workloads has its challenges. For starters, what if the number of requests grows 2x, 10x, or 100x? Or, what if the data volume goes from 10GB to 100GB and then 1TB? And what if a cloud availability zone that hosts the API layer experiences outages?\n\nJoin this hands-on session on 16 March 2022 at 9am PT on LinkedIn Live, where Denis Magda, Director, Developer Relations at Yugabyte and Praveen Durairaju, Senior Developer Advocate at Hasura, will build a cloud native GraphQL API layer. You’ll learn how this API scales horizontally to serve ever-growing data volumes with user requests while tolerating various cloud outages.\n\nYou’ll also explore:\n-How to provision a scalable GraphQL layer with Hasura Cloud.\n-How to deploy a distributed and resilient data layer with Yugabyte Cloud.\n-How to assemble a final solution by interconnecting Hasura and Yugabyte Cloud.\n\nYou can attend and register for the event here: https://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:6903074206444331008/",

We will be looking into new and upcoming events to watch out for. Discuss all the exciting launches in TinyML, especially around Asia and SG. So join us for welcome back session and informal meet and greet!\n\n1\\. Welcome and Introduction to TinyML SG\n2\\. Things to look out for in TinyML\n3\\. SG Communities on TinyML\n4\\. Meet and Greet\n\nVincent’s areas of focus are AI + Robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Cloud & Edge Computing, and Community Building. Currently, he is a Product & Sales Manager working along with an AI unicorn company based in Shenzhen (UBTECH Robotics). Vincent is actively involved with the developer community, loves empowering others to learn and share their work. He enjoys attending Maker Faire events worldwide, to learn about different innovations and network with like-minded people. Act as Community Evangelist for the Embedded Systems Professionals Discord channel, FIRST by Packt: [Embedded System Professionals](https://discord.gg/U9VxMpm7eG). Vincent has a passion for constant learning and keeping himself current with the latest technology and its applications and the impact it has on the community. His tagline is “GET INSPIRED, MAKE THINGS HAPPEN!”\n\nSoham is a machine learning engineer at [Sleek Tech](https://sleek.com/sg/), Singapore. Previously, he was a research master’s Student at NTU where he did research on combining edge computing techniques with neuromorphic hardware to build optimized microcontrollers. He is also the instructor for Udacity Nanodegree “[Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/intel-edge-ai-for-iot-developers-nanodegree--nd131)”, where he taught how to optimize models for edge computing applications. Soham’s passion for TinyML and MLOps led him to combine the two to build tools and techniques to efficiently and easily deploy TinyML models including [ScaleDown](https://scaledown-team.github.io/) where he is a core developer. Apart from this, Soham is also the instructor for Udacity’s “[Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-for-microsoft-azure-nanodegree--nd00333)” Nanodegree and “[AWS Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd189)” Nanodegree.\n\nArchana works as a Data Scientist at DHL Express. She loves dabbling in TinyML i.e applying machine learning models to small devices with low power and memory requirements. She is currently running the [ScaleDown project](https://scaledown-team.github.io/). After work, you can usually find Archana at Women Who Code, helping to build analytics dashboards for online events.\n\nWe encourage you to register earlier since on-line broadcast capacity may be limited.\n\nNote: tinyML Talks slides and videos will be available on the tinyML website and tinyML YouTube Channel afterwards, for those who missed the live session.

Experts in data science and machine learning are working hard to bring this to embedded engineers and young programmers so that they can solve some real life problems using ML, more specifically tinyML without being an expert on this field. Once such platform is Edge Impulse which makes building ML model so intuitive that a middle schooler can learn and use for good. Join us in this talk where a 6th-grade student Sashrika Das will explain why and how she built a gas leak detection project using Wio Terminal, Multi-channnel gas sensor, and Edge Impulse Studio. Her device can smell diesel leaking from the tank and alert owner in real time. Sashrika will also share some tips for students her age to get started with tinyML. Meanwhile her dad, Mithun Das will showcase his project Camper which sees animal /human even in the dark using a thermal camera, Wio Terminal and Edge Impulse.\n\nMithun Das is a distinguished software engineer at Cox Automotive with 17 years of experience in software, ambassador at Edge Impulse & Balena. He obtained bachelors degree in “Information Technology” from IIEST, India. At Cox, innovation is in their culture which brought Mithun to the world IoT. For last 4-5 years, he has been working on IoT and ML for good. He has implemented many proof of concepts including low cost contact tracing, smart parking reducing carbon emission, saving peatlands using tinyML, smart collar for elephant, hearing substitution using haptic feedback are few of them.\n\nSashrika Das is a 6th grade student at East Lyme Middle School in Connecticut, USA. She is passionate about Internet of Things and programming. She participates in virtual contests such as “The coolest project” , “do your:bit”. She has started learning tinyML recently with guidance from her parent, and created proof of concept of some of her ideas.\n\nWe encourage you to register earlier since on-line broadcast capacity may be limited.\n\nNote: tinyML Talks slides and videos will be available on the tinyML website and tinyML YouTube Channel afterwards, for those who missed the live session.

In all areas of society, digital data is now abundant, but also unstructured and pretty much unexploited. Animal ecology is no exception and the lat years have seen an increase of use of digital sensing to observe an undestand the animal realm. In this talk, I will present some success stories at the interface of machine learning and conservation, where camera traps and drone data were used to support censing, population estimation and general understanding of animal behavior. I will then sketch a number of points of synergetic action necessary to strengthen such interface, a necessary step to jointly tackling the biodiversity crisis.\n\nDevis completed his PhD at University of Lausanne, Switzerland, where he studied kernel methods for hyperspectral satellite data. He then traveled the world as a postdoc, first at University of València, then at CU Boulder and finally back to EPFL. In 2014, he became assistant professor at University of Zurich, and in 2017 he moved to Wageningen University in the Netherlands, where he was chair of the Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing Laboratory. Since September 2020, he is back to EPFL, where he leads the Environmental Computational Science and Earth Observation laboratory (ECEO) in Sion. There, he studies the Earth from above with machine learning and computer vision.\n\nWe encourage you to register earlier since on-line broadcast capacity may be limited.\n\nNote: tinyML Talks slides and videos will be available on the tinyML website and tinyML YouTube Channel afterwards, for those who missed the live session.

        "description": "The pandemic disrupted and changed the way consumers interact with organisations, expecting and demanding accessibility 24/7 through the use of digital channels. From medical support, rescheduling holidays to obtaining emergency loans, call centers were at the center of it all. In a time that heavily influenced consumer loyalty, slow responses, high attrition rates, call volumes and delays, organisations faced a huge loss in brand confidence.\n\nAt the same time, how can we provide 24/7 accessibility without the need of investing in more staff, whilst improving customer and employee satisfaction? How can complex requests be handled and managed without expanding?\n\nWith the advances in Process Automation and Machine Learning, we believe the answer lies in Conversational AI to provide human-like experiences with meaningful, outcomes based experiences. Join this webinar to learn how conversational AI will change the way contact centers operate and how companies are benefiting from it today.\n\nAbout CGI\nFounded in 1976, CGI is among the largest IT and business consulting services firms in the world. We are insights-driven and outcomes-based to help accelerate returns on your investments. We are delighted to be partnering with them to implement the platform for clients.\n\nAbout Artificial Solutions\nDesigned for the global enterprise, Artificial Solutions’ advanced conversational AI platform Teneo allows business users and developers to collaborate on creating sophisticated, highly intelligent applications that run across over 86 languages, multiple OS and channels in record time.",
