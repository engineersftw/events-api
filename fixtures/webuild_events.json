SPEAKERS Mario Behling (http://twitter.com/mariobehling) founded SUSI AI together with Michael Christen 2016 after they have collaborated for several years on big data project loklak. Mario is a German born technologist with 15 years of experience in software development and startups. In the past he also helped to get the lubuntu community started, run an IT development company in Vietnam, and set-up mesh networks in Afghan schools. Le Zhang is Data Scientist from Microsoft. He is with the Algorithms and Data Science Asia Pacific team, where he develops tools for machine learning on cloud and reusable solution templates that accelerate the process of resolving data science problems in various domains. He holds Ph. D. degree in Computer Engineering and he is a vim lover.   Viktor Gal (https://twitter.com/vikgl) is currently working as a data scientist. He got involved in the development of Shogun, while working on his PhD in computer science, in the are of medical image processing. He is currently one of the core developers of the library, and in the last three years he has co-mentored half a dozen Google Summer of Code projects. PROJECTS  SUSI AI is an intelligent Open Source personal assistant. It is capable of chat and voice interaction and to perform actions such as music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, and other real time information. Additional functionalities can be added as console services using external APIs. Susi AI is able to answer questions and depending on the context will ask for additional information in order to perform a desired outcome. The core of the assistant is the SUSI AI server that holds the \"intelligence\" and \"personality\" of SUSI. The Android and web applications make use of the APIs to access information from a hosted server. The SUSI AI code is available on GitHub. Commercial licenses and support is available through the SUSI AI startup. Code: https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server  Employee Churn Predictive Analysis - This session will walk through an industry project that predicts employee churn through sentiment analysis. This is a real-world case that Microsoft Data Scientists had been working on, and has been deployed for real use. Through the practical case, we will share the methodologies, algorithms, techniques, tools used and the rational for such choices. Our Data Scientist will also share the R based data science solution accelerator that has been developed forboosting prototyping, documenting, and presenting R based data science projects, which can be of use in other projects. https://github.com/Microsoft/acceleratoRs/ Shogun provides a wide range of unified and efficient Machine Learning (ML) methods. The toolbox seamlessly allows to easily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. Website: http://shogun-toolbox.org",

While Java is the de facto language for developing Android applications, C# allows to leverage the power of Xamarin to target Android as well as iOS, UWP and MacOs platforms, with unrestricted access to all targets latest APIs while being 100% native. In our March session we will look at the similarities and differences between the Java and C# languages, including mobile centric features such as asynchronous programming.We will go through the development environment basics with a side by side features demo of Android Studio and Visual Studio. Then we will go through the common Xamarin cross platform architecture available and when to use them, as well as how to achieve optimal code reuse between the different targets offered by the framework. By the end of the session you will have a clear understanding whereas Xamarin is right for you and how steep the learning curve actually is to get yourself ready to develop once, and ship to the platforms of your choice.

This week we're really excited to have Virgil Griffith talk about the dark web, bitcoin and legaltech.\n\nTitle: Darkweb, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Legaltech\n\nDescription:\nI'll be showing a collection of recent work I've done in the darkweb, blockchain, and legaltech space.\n\nHighlights include:\n\n* I own and operate the world's largest search engine and proxy for the darkweb, http://onion.link, enabling all manner of analyses of darkweb content and traffic.\n* a system by which regulators can freeze bitcoin accounts.\n* an entrepreneurial graph to stand alongside the Erdos and Bacon collaboration graphs.\n* the very first graph of the Ethereum contract ecosystem.\n* an Ethereum powered light-weight replacement for commercial VPNs.\n* the potential of a domain-specific language instantiating a \"Periodic Table of Contracts\" to negotiate contracts between IoT devices and revolutionize the creation of smart-contracts and traditional legal drafting.\n\n\nSpeaker Profile:\nVirgil Griffith is a postdoctoral fellow at smart.mit.edu, contractor for the Ethereum Foundation, and cofounder of the Legalese opensource project. Virgil's primary interests are in smart-contracts/Ethereum, arcane corners of higher mathematics, and technologies that interplay privacy and transperancy for collective good. His favorite tools are information theory, graph theory, Haskell, and large harddrives. Virgil believes a rigorous formalization of obligation structures will bring about a global digitization with an impact of >1T dollars and is teaching himself deonitic logic and formal verification to make this happen.  Virgil received his PhD from Caltech studying info-theoretic measures of quantifying the functional complexity of neural networks. His Erdős-Bacon number is 6. A New York Times biography dubbed him the \"Internet Man of Mystery\".",

This week we'll be covering chapter 7 VM I: Stack Arithmetic (week 1 of the course). It's going to be the first week of this new 7-week course (session starting on 13th March) so be sure to join us now and we can learn and push through the homework &amp; project deadlines together. It's easier to complete such a course in a group. Trust us, we've done it. :)  \"I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing, I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed.\" Shimon Schocken, the author of the book talks about the course at TED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7YRHxwoDs How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter and try out (better yet, complete) this week's course homework before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues! Book club is held at Tim &amp; Wei's residence: 244A Tanjong Katong RdSingapore  437032Singapore Doors open at 6:30, meetup starts at 7. Bring snacks and drinks of your choice!  FAQ Do I have to take Nand to Tetris Part I before taking Nand to Tetris Part II? From the Coursera course FAQ: \"Nand to Tetris Part I and Nand to Tetris Part II are two separate and stand alone courses. Although it is recommended to take Part I before taking Part II, you can take any of these courses, in any order that suites you.\" Feel free to ask questions in the SingaporeJS bookclub gitter room: https://gitter.im/SingaporeJS/discussions/bookclub Useful Links • NAND to Tetris website: http://www.nand2tetris.org/ • Get the book: http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ • Coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2",

            "description": "Concurrency by itself is easy until you start facing strange heisenbugs or hard to reproduce deadlocks. Safe concurrency is no piece of cake. Goroutines, channels, and select statement provided by Go make concurrent programming easy, but not necessarily safe. “Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating. ” is idiomatic in Go, but it can hardly be enforced. In some cases using channels may be overkill, thus making \"good old\" synchronized sharing the most effective and convenient solution. However, sharing mutable data without proper synchronization leads to data races. This is the main cause of race conditions, aka Public Enemy #1. This talk will introduce two ways to avoid data races: detection in runtime with tools like the race detector provided by Go, and forbidding race conditions at compile time with the type system as Rust does. This talk will also explain why no data races does not mean no race conditions and will include a discussion on how to avoid race conditions in general.

He will be sharing how he combines 3D printing with wood working and electronics to create his projects.\n\nTalk 2: Jason Loo\nJason will be talking about the applications of 3D printing in the entertainment industry for props and toys. His 3D printed artifacts includes a lifesize BB8 as well as a iron man mask.\n\nTalk 3: Hanyang Leong\nOften, 3d printed pieces taken right off the printbed will tend to appear raw, plasticky and unfinished. However, there are actually a myraid of post-processing techniques one can apply to take your 3d printed projects to a much better finish. Join us as we share some of the post-processing techniques we typically use in Funbie Studios to finish 3d printed projects - joining of smaller pieces, gap filling,  surface finishing and paintwork application. Some of the pieces will be showcased as part of the sharing too.\"\n\nRegister Here\nhttps://www.eventbrite.sg/e/creative-crew-talks-stories-in-3d-printing-tickets-32407802610",

            "description": "In Deep Learning (a specific technique in the ecosystem of AI) - lots of data is used to train the AI Algorithm - specifically deep neural networks. In this case, the data becomes part of the \"code\". Wrong input data - wrong models generated in the end. Hence it is critically important to track, trace and validate ALL data used to train and test the algorithm. Pachyderm is a data lake that offers complete version control for data and leverages the container ecosystem to provide reproducible data processing. As data scientists, we know the best ideas come through collaboration. We also know reproducibility matters. Pachyderm makes both a reality, and this talk shows how. We’ll talk about data containers and analysis pipelines, and how they combine to make Pachyderm a Git for Data Science and AI R&amp;D. 6.30pm - 7.00pm : Networking 7.00pm - 7.40pm : Pachyderm - Git for Data Science by Najib NinabaNajib will share an overview of Pachyderm, infrastructure requirements and a quick demo of the installation and how-to. 7.50pm - 8.30pm : Using Pachyderm with RJeanne will share how a typical data scientist working with R and his/her datasets will be use Pachyderm to ensure reproducibility. About the speakers: Najib Ninaba has been involved in High Performance Computing since 2000 and has been at the inflection point of Cloud and Analytics. Products he has managed and delivered includes Scalable Rocks, Platform Cluster Manager, Revolution Analytics's CloudR and RevoR integration into Cloudera Manager. Jeanne Choo comes from the world of biology and small data - think coral reef, beaver, and plant gene datasets, painstakingly collected. Currently a big data mage apprentice.",

As an advisor, he helps startups recognize, evaluate, and navigate security and business risks. Andreas was also one of the first to use the phrase “The Internet of Money”, as early as 2013, to describe bitcoin as part of his speaking business. \n\n\nAs a bitcoin entrepreneur, Andreas has founded a number of bitcoin businesses and launched several community open-source projects. He is a widely published author of articles and blog posts on bitcoin, is a permanent host on the popular Let’s Talk Bitcoin Podcast, and a frequent speaker at technology and security conferences worldwide. \n\n\nYou can find out more and watch some of his past events at https://antonopoulos.com/ This event is being co-organized with the Ethereum Singapore Meetup, and sponsored by ACCESS, The Singapore Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association http://www.access-sg.org/ 7.00 Check-in 7.25 Introduction 7.30 Talk Starts 8.00 Q&amp;A 8.15 Community Networking 8.45 Closing PLEASE RSVP TO RESERVE YOUR SPOT!!!! \n\n\nVenue Support:   https://skbi.smu.edu.sg Cheers, Bitcoin Singapore and Ethereum Singapore",

We plan to have three sections to cover the range of experience that we hope will attend :  1.  Working with Images : CNN models will be introduced by Martin, from the basics.  But, quickly building on that, we'll delve into ways to fool the network, and then attempt to fix the problem by stacking on an autoencoder!  2.  For the \"aiming higher\" talk, Sam will explain the basics of one of the current hot topics : Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), including some quirky variations. 3.  We'll round things out with a \"Lightning Talks\" slot, where we welcome folks to come up and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (if you have slides, then #max=10).  The key for the Lightning Talks slot is simply the cool/interesting factor.  It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or and enthusiastic beginner : Given the response we had to the last event, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.  Please suggest yourself here : https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/suggestion/ No word yet on the Pizza situation, so probably best to grab a bite before/after the event. ",

Many try to adopt innovation methods practiced by startups (customer development, MVPs, validated learning, intrapreneurship, etc.) while some even try to annex whole startups through incubation and accelerator programs. Unfortunately, the outcomes have been a mixed bag. Lean startup practices are hard to implement in large organizations, and feisty startups rarely thrive within rigid corporate frameworks. This collaborative meetup series between NUS Enterprise and Design Innovation SG will explore if there is a better way for corporations to tap the entrepreneurship wave. We shall examine how Design Thinking strategies may be adapted to help companies better engage the startup ecosystem. Experienced innovators, designers, strategists and practitioners will be invited to share and discuss what did and did not work in their own innovation journeys. Seminar repeat every 3rd Tuesday of the month.  Please only sign up, if you are coming as the spaces are limited and bring your business card with you. ",

Freedom from work. Technological marvels. Abundance. The robots are coming, and we are helpless to stop them. Should we stop them, especially from taking our jobs? Or are they going to help us create an even better future? In an article appearing in the Straits Times on 6 March 2017, MIT research scientist Dr Andrew McAfee says:- Machines are going to put many people out of jobs- Jobs that require creative or social interaction skills are more likely to endure- Workers should acquire skills complementary to machines- Machines would create a world where labour costs drop to zero, people would be freed up to do things other than work, and there would be startling abundance- Education systems need to be overhauled- Countries need to develop an environment conducive to entrepreneurship, including investing in the right infrastructure and opening up to immigration- Governments need to support basic research while companies focus on applied research- Technological progress should not be held back- The big winners will be those who create and own the machines, while those on the wrong side of the divide will find it difficult to gain access to the bounty created These are just some of the common views that are circulating these days. Do you agree with them? What are your own view? Do you have ideas that can be integrated into a concrete plan of action? Do you think the use of artificial intelligence should be regulated by law? Do you think we need to modify our existing political and economic institutions to adapt to a future of robots? Come discuss and share!",

Unfortunately, the outcomes have been a mixed bag. Lean startup practices are hard to implement in large organizations, and feisty startups rarely thrive within rigid corporate frameworks.  This collaborative meetup series between NUS Enterprise and Design Innovation SG will explore if there is a better way for corporations to tap the entrepreneurship wave. We shall examine how Design Thinking strategies may be adapted to help companies better engage the startup ecosystem. Experienced innovators, designers, strategists and practitioners will be invited to share and discuss what did and did not work in their own innovation journeys. In the first seminar on 21st February at 6pm, we will explore how to bring &gt;&gt; Design Thinking into Organizations &lt;&lt;.
